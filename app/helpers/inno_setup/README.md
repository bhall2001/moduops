# inno_setup

Inno Setup is a free installer system for Windows available at http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php. This helper fills in a template `.iss` file with the files and folders in your application each time you package your application. The resulting file is placed in the package folder alongside the `windows` folder.

If you run this helper on Windows then it can be configured to automatically compile the resulting `.iss` file using a local installation of Inno Setup. If you are running it on macOS or Linux then Wine can be used to compile the `.iss` file. If you are using Wine you will not be able to sign the installer using the Inno Setup SignTool setting, however.

## Activate the inno_setup helper

To add the inno_setup helper to your application you must download it and add the `inno_setup` folder to your application `helpers` folder.

Click on the green **Clone or download** button on the GitHub page and select **Download ZIP** from the menu that appears. Grab the folder from the archive and rename it to `inno_setup`. Add the renamed folder to your application `helpers` folder.

## Generating an .iss file when packaging your application

The Inno Setup helper works by inserting references to all of the files and folders in the root directory of your application folder into an existing `.iss` file. The helper will replace the variable `[[FilesAndFoldersToInstall]]` with the file and folder references. If your application contains any root level folders that are empty then they will be used to replace the `[[DirectoriesToCreate]]` variable in the `[Dir]` section of the `.iss` file.

You will add configuration information to two locations within the `app.yml` file.

### `inno setup` section

The first location will be a new configuration setting named `inno setup`. It looks like this:

```
# app.yml

inno setup:
  file flags:
  folder flags:
  executable flags:
  compiler:
```

The `file flags`, `folder flags`, and `executable flags` properties specify the flags that will be added to the file and folder entries in the `.iss` file. The `windows compiler` property is set to the path to Inno Setup `Compil32.exe` compiler. When running on Windows the helper will try to compile the `.iss` script.

`file flags`: Flags that will be added to all files added to the `.iss` file.
`folder flags`: Flags that will be added to all folders added to the `.iss` file.
`executable flags`: Flags that will be added to the executable file that is added to the `.iss` file.
`windows compiler`: Windows path to the Inno Setup `Compil32.exe` file.
`wine compiler`: Wine path to the Inno Setup `Compile32.exe` file.

Here is an example:

```
# app.yml

inno setup:
  file flags: ignoreversion
  folder flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
  executable flags: ignorevesion sign
  windows compiler: C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5\Compil32.exe
  wine compiler: wine compiler: /Users/myusername/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Inno Setup 5/Compil32.exe
```

```
# .iss file
...

Source: ".\windows\Externals\*"; DestDir: "{app}\Externals"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
Source: ".\windows\helpers\*"; DestDir: "{app}\helpers"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
Source: ".\windows\locales\*"; DestDir: "{app}\locales"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
Source: ".\windows\ui\*"; DestDir: "{app}\ui"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs
Source: ".\windows\app.livecodescript"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\behaviors.livecode"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\frontscripts.livecode"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\levure.livecodescript"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\libraries.livecode"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\revsecurity.dll"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion
Source: ".\windows\ScreenSteps.exe"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: ignoreversion sign

...
```

### `copy files` section

The second location you will be in one or more `copy files` sections under `build profiles`. You will add an `inno setup` section with references to the `.iss` file(s) that you want to copy over into the package folder when you package an application. Here is an example that copies the `./build files/MyApp.iss` file for all build profiles. Note the optional `compile` parameter. Set to `false` if the helper should not try to compile the script.

```
# app.yml

build profiles:
  all profiles:
    post build script:
    copy files:
      inno setup:
        - filename: ../build files/MyApp.iss
          compile: true
```

## Setting up the `.iss` file

When setting up the `.iss` file that the Inno Setup helper will use you will configure every setting except for your application files in the `[Files]` section. In the `[Files]` section you will include the string `[[FilesAndFoldersToInstall]]` on a line by itself. There are some other variables you can use in the file as well.

`[[NAME]]`: The `name` property from `app.yml`.
`[[APP_VERSION]]`: The first two numbers from `version` in `app.yml` (e.g. 2.0).
`[[MAJOR_VERSION]]`: The first number from the `version` property in `app.yml` (e.g. 2).
`[[BUILD]]`: The `build` property from `app.yml`.
`[[BUILD_PROFILE]]`: The build profile used to package the application.


### Example:

```
...
[Setup]
SignTool=signtool
AppName=[[NAME]]
AppVerName=[[NAME]] [[APP_VERSION]]
...

[Files]

[[FilesAndFoldersToInstall]]

[Dir]

[[DirectoriesToCreate]]

[Tasks]
Name: "desktopicon"; Description: "{cm:CreateDesktopIcon}"; GroupDescription: "{cm:AdditionalIcons}"; Flags:
...
```

## Installing Wine on OS X

The helper will try to detect if Wine is installed on non-Windows computers. If Wine is installed and the `wine compiler` property is set then the helper will try to compile the scripts. For instructions on installing Wine on OS X see the following url:

## TODO

### Use SignTool feature with Wine

You can define a SignTool to use with Inno Setup. This allows you to sign files added to the installer as well as the uninstaller and installer that are created. When running under windows you can use the `signtool.exe` executable that comes with the Windows SDK. This executable doesn't appear to work under Wine, however.

### Automate Wine

It should be possible to do the following so that the path to the Wine compiler doesn't have to be entered in the `app.yml` file:

1. Detect if Wine is installed
2. Determine the Program Files directory
3. Determine if Inno Setup is installed
4. Run the command.

The following url has a gist has a script that does just that:
