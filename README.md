Software for Model Railroad Operations

ModuOps is a software project for Free-mo AND home layouts looking for software to assist in operation. ModuOps will generate trainlists (also known as switchlists) used during operating sessions. The software is FREE to download and includes a fully functional system with basic features. A yearly nominal subscription unlocks additional features and advanced scheduling engines.

ModuOps is designed with the nuances of operating a Free-mo modular setup as it's primary criteria. Operations in this environment are quite different than operating a static layout. As an example, in a Free-mo setup, the "layout" is different every time it is put together.

Rollingstock is not known until individuals place on the layout the items they've brought to the setup. Keeping track of individual car details adds a layer of administration that is time consuming and impractical for a setup that may only last for a single day.

Does this mean the software can not be used on your home layout? Well, no it doesn't. ModuOps is used to operate  home layouts bringing a level of realism to your operating sessions without adding unnecessary complexity setting up the session. What you will see is your layout comes alive and Operators having fun while running the layout.

ModuOps is in the development phase at this point. Available here for download is the FREE version of the software containing the most basic scheduling engine and features to get you going.
