### ModuOps 1.0.0d59 Release Notes

#### New in this Version
- Added Remarks to Consignee's
- Module remarks can now be multiple lines
- About ModuOps menu now works
- Fixed Limit Modules in Train Edit screen not updating.
- Decided to leave Windows disabled buttons alone. I don't like the way Windows shows disabled buttons but this it is what it is. I'll wait and see if any comments come in about not being able to tell what is enabled/disabled...

#### What's Not Working...
Drop Zones in a Module/Town have a "Direction" which is the direction the zone faces to be a trailing drop. Currently implemented are the A and B directions. What is not implemented yet is AB (a drop zone that is accessible from both directions). And yes, we know that a module could have any number of "directions". For version 1 you will find 2 directions, A and B with more options coming in future versions.

None of the Preferences screen fields are active yet. Data can be typed in to the fields, but the data is not used, nor is it saved or loaded to/from that data file.
