### ModuOps 1.0.0d60 Release Notes

#### New in this Version
- Equipment Register now sorts by Length+Description+Class
- Adding a Specific Consignee to route no in Route direction
- Added ability to Not Service Consignee when creating train route
- Fixed issues with output formatting
- Mac version is crashing sometimes on initial launch. Just re-launch and you should be good to go. No fix yet but looking into the cause.

#### What's Not Working...
Drop Zones in a Module/Town have a "Direction" which is the direction the zone faces to be a trailing drop. Currently implemented are the A and B directions. What is not implemented yet is AB (a drop zone that is accessible from both directions). And yes, we know that a module could have any number of "directions". For version 1 you will find 2 directions, A and B with more options coming in future versions.

None of the Preferences screen fields are active yet. Data can be typed in to the fields, but the data is not used, nor is it saved or loaded to/from that data file.
