## New Equipment

To create new equipment, click the "New" button. This takes you to the Equipment details screen.

Items in red are required elements when defining your equipment.

Select the equipment's classification from the drop down list. The list contains standard classification for Equipment.

Select the era of the equipment from the Era drop down list. The options allow yard crews to select a car to best fit the era requested.

Add a concise description of your equipment.

In many situations, ModuOps uses the short description of you equipment. There are a lot of options for how to use the short description. This could be a shorten version of the longer description, or possibly a code such as the standard AAR code for the equipment. For more information on AAR codes as they pertain to model railroads, we recommend the efforts of the Ops Sig group at http://www.opsig.org/pdf/AARFreightCarCodes.pdf.

The length of the equipment you define should be in scale feet. Make sure you stay consistent with the unit of measurement when defining other options requiring a length.

Remarks are optional when defining the equipment. The remarks are typically displayed on the output form when the car type is selected for use on a train. The remarks are intended for the crew handling the equipment and may contain information such as "Hazardous" or "Flammable".

When you have entered all the information, click "Done".
