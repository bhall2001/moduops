Here's the order you'll want to do things in to get going.

2. Create a Module/Town
3. Create a Consignee or 2
4. Create a Drop Zone or 2 (or 3)
5. Return to the Consignee details screen and add in a Car Request or 2

Additional tips:
* Keep unit of measurment of rollingstock, drop zones and train length consistent. We suggest feet.
* Train length must be set to a value greater than the shortest rollingstock.
* Drop Zones handle many cars buy setting the length of the zone. The legnth should be greater than or equal to the total length of the rollingstock intended to go there. A drop zone of 150 feet can hold 3 (50 foot) box cars.
