![ModuOps Dashboard](http://www.moduops.com/images/manual/dashboard.png)

ModuOps is designed to be easy to use and navigate. This is the first screen you see when starting the Application. From this screen you have access to the most common items needed to use the application.

On the left side of the screen is a menu bar. This menu bar appears on all screens. You will find buttons that take you to the major categories of the software.

Your current location is always displayed as the title of the screen. In the example above, this is the "Dashboard" screen. Just below that are breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs show you where you are within the application.

The dashboard screen features an overview of the current data file loaded in. Here you can see actual counts for Modules/Towns, Rollingstock, Consignees, Drop Zones, Car Requests and trains.

Just below this section are groups of menu's organized by like categories. Use these menu's to navigate to an section of the application that you need to work on.

You can always return to the Dashboard screen by clicking on the Dashboard menu on the left side of the screen.
